I'm a 5th-year undergraduate student in the Statistics department at Seoul National University. I'm also working as a data scientist in [NAVER](/https://www.navercorp.com/en/) Search Quality Evaluation team. 

My research interests include semiparametric inference, Biostatistics, Bayesian statistics, and statistical computation. My current projects involve R package development for local-FDR estimation, semiparametric mixture methods for local-FDR estimation,  multi-marker panel development for pancreatic cancer, and a graph-enhanced click model for search quality enhancement. 

This is my most recent [CV][1].
